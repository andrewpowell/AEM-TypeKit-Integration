==================
ABOUT THIS PROJECT
==================

This project provides a component and a page to provide Adobe TypeKit fonts to a CQ Template.
You must have a valid TypeKit ID to use this.  Additionally, this only includes the TypeKit
functionality to load the fonts from TypeKit.  You must still configure your CSS to use the
proper fonts from your kit.

This project was inspired by and derived from the CQ Typekit integration component component
created by David Benge (dbenge@adobe.com) at Adobe.


=====================
